I am tasked with building an Information Retrieval system using the Boolean Retrieval method and the Learn-to-Rank algorithm. This system is built to interact with the Cranfield Dataset. 

The Cranfield dataset is a small, historically significant collection of scientific abstracts used to evaluate early information retrieval (IR) systems. Created during the Cranfield experiments in the 1960s, it provided a standard benchmark for assessing IR system performance. Though too small for modern applications, it is still used for teaching, testing baseline models, and exploring the history of IR.

# Cranfield - Boolean Shortlist & XGBoost LTR Ranking

Built an end-to-end Information Retrieval system using the Cranfield dataset, combining Boolean retrieval for candidate generation and XGBoost (LambdaMART) for learning-to-rank. Implemented an inverted index, feature engineering for queryâ€“document pairs, and evaluated ranking performance using metrics like Precision@k, MAP, and nDCG. Deployed an interactive Streamlit interface for querying and visualizing ranked results.
## How to Run the Code
To start everything off, we need to install all the requirements
```bash
  python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
  python -m nltk.downloader stopwords punkt
```
Then we need to build the inverted indices for the system and train the XGBoost Model
```bash
  python ./train.py
```
Further we need to run the evaluation for the Precision@k, MAP and nDCG. For this specific script, you will see the results for n = 10 for baseline metrics
```bash
  python ./evaluate.py
```
Finally we host the entire dataset on Streamlit for interfacing with it and actually using the system we have built
```bash
  python -m streamlit run ./app.py
```
## Results

Following are the results for the Cranfield Dataset using Boolean Shortlisting and Learn-to-Rank algorithm. 

Based on the primitive evaluation on the main datatset

This is the graph comparing the normal Boolean Shortlisting and the Learn-to-Rank Model

You can also run the following queries to judge the system's Boolean Shortlising and the XGBoost LTR retrieval.

```bash
  thermodynamic jet propulsion
```
```bash
  aerodynamic streamlining
```
